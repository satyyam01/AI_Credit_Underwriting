    st.markdown("""
        This project was developed as part of my **AI internship** at **Infosys Springboard**. The objective was to build a **Loan Prediction System** that uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various parameters like personal and financial details of the applicant.
        The system takes the user's input and processes it through a pre-trained model to deliver a prediction about the loan status. We used algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees** for accurate predictions.

    st.markdown("### 🏗️ System Architecture")
    st.markdown("""
        The **Loan Prediction System** architecture is designed to seamlessly collect user inputs, process them through a machine learning model, and deliver accurate predictions for loan approval. Here's a breakdown of the system components:

        1. **User Interface (UI)**: The front-end interface built using **Streamlit** allows users to input their personal and financial information.
        2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data entered by users is cleaned and transformed into numerical values, ensuring compatibility with the machine learning model.
        3. **Machine Learning Model**: The core of the system is a trained model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression), which predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on historical data.
        4. **Prediction Engine**: The system runs the model on the preprocessed data and returns the loan approval decision.
        5. **Visualization & Output**: The result is displayed to the user in a clear format with feedback on whether the loan is likely to be approved or rejected.

        Below is a diagram of the system architecture for better understanding:

    # Activity Log Section
    st.markdown("### 📊 Project Activity Log")
    st.markdown("""
        Throughout my internship, I engaged in various key activities to contribute to the **Loan Prediction System** project:

        1. **Data Collection**: Gathered relevant data from past loan applicants, including financial history, loan amounts, and approval outcomes.
        2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed categorical data to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
        3. **Model Selection**: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to find the best-performing model.
        4. **Model Training & Optimization**: Trained the model on historical data, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.
        5. **Deployment & Testing**: Deployed the trained model into the Streamlit application, tested the prediction system with real user inputs, and optimized its performance.

        This project has provided me with hands-on experience in **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **AI deployment**, which are essential skills for any AI professional.
